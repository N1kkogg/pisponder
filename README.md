# pisponder

Run Responder locally on a Raspberry Pi Zero. Just like a LAN Turtle found here:

pisponder is my first script. All it does is turn a Raspberry Pi Zero running Raspbian lite into a NTLMv2 hash stealing machine (even when the other computer is locked!).

Download pisponder.sh, chmod 755 it and then run as root
I have only tested this script on the raspberry pi zero 1.3
